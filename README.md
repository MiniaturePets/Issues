# Miniature Pets

Create, share, and use custom companions like frog, panda, turtle, and more!

## Getting Started

Getting Started with issues, wiki and projects.

### Issues

We allow the public to post issues on this repository, we love everything organized and kept in one place so we decided using GitHub is the best idea.

### Projects

We invite you to check the Projects tab to see development process in real-time and ideas suggested by you getting inside the list.

### Wiki

The Wiki is ment to simplify the API and Configuration Files and in general be the first source of support for the community.

## Getting Support

We are highly available throught many platforms to make getting support as easy as possible!

### Discord Server

We invite you to join our Discord server! Please bring some food as we're hungry.
